1. man shows the manual for the terminal command that follows it, providing additional information. 
Man rm would show the manual for the move command. 
To scroll, you use the arrows keys. To exit, you press the 'q' key

2. The -l flag in regards to ls would list the content of your current directory but with additional
information, like creation date. The -a command shows all hidden files.

3. ALT + LEFT OR RIGHT ARRROW

4. CTRL + e 

5. CTRL + a

6. CTRL + w

7. The shell is the program that processes commands and returns an output,
while the terminal is the overarching program that runs the shell.

8. An absolute path is that path to a certain file/folder starting at the root directory (the full address).

9. A relative path would be one that does not containa full address from the root file, but is instead a level up or down from 
where you currently are. This path would only require the name of the location you are pathing into (with cd or cd ..).

10. Flags are single, double, (or sometimes triple) letter addages that are placed after
a command to change or enhance a command. For example, the -a flag would enable display of hidden files,
the -l flag enables long list format (showing a more detailed version of the list), and the -r flag reverses
the order of items displayed in the list.

11. In regards to the rm (remove) command, the -r flag removes directories and their contents recursively,
and the -f flag forces a comman by ignoring arguments. Combining both would force the removal of a directory 
and all its contents.
