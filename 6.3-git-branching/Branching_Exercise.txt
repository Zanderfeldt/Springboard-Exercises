1. git branch -b

2. Fast forward merge is the most simplie of merges, where git
is esily able to detect a set of commits, and put one on top of the
other chronologically. A recursive merge happens when there are many different
commits happening at different times on different branches. When attempting to merge,
the git is unable to detect the order of changes chronologically, so the user is prompted
to decide which changes are kept and which are deleted in the merge.

3. git checkout

4. git branch -D

5. Merge conflicts happen when there are multiple commits with changes to the same
file, so Git doesn't know which file to merge/ which changes to apply.
